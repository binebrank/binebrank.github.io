> Congratulations, you have successfully completed the requirements needed to achieve LFCS Certification!

is written in the first paragraph of the email that I have been waiting for an entire day. Yesterday morning was my second attempt to successfully pass LFCS exam. I have achieved an overall score of 97%.

I have been working with linux operating system for over 3 years already and I felt that my skills deserve a confirmation in a form of a professionally renowned linux certificate. LFCS is an online, proctored, performance-based test offered by The Linux Foundation. It consists of various tasks which need to be solved from a command line on a Linux server (which runs a distribution of your choice). 
I have selected an Ubuntu 18.04, as this has been my go-to distribution at work.

Exam consists of 24 tasks focusing on the following topics:
- Essential Commands
- Operation of Running Systems
- User and Group Managment
- Networking
- Service Configuration
- Storage Managment
