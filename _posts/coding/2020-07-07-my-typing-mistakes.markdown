If you are doing a certain thing all your life, you better do it efficiently.

A couple of weeks back, I was watching an educational stream on competitive programming by Errichto. His guest was William Lin, another top competitive programmer.
To warm up their fingers before problem solving, they played a couple of typeracer games. William Lin managed to type with speed of around 130-140 words per minute.
His keyboard sounded like some over the top hacking scene from your favourite Mr. Robot episode. It was pretty impressive.
My typing speed has been pretty much the same for the past 5 years probably. I have never put any real effort into improving this skill.
I am able to touch type, t. i. not looking at the keyboard when I type. Despite this, my typing speed is probably not much better than any average IT student.
I have played a few typeracer.com games and was averaging around 45 words per minute. I was determined to increase this number in the near future.

I was browsing through some typing tutorials on the internet and refreshed my knowledge on typing. I already knew that each character on the keyboard should in theory always be pressed with the same finger. Still, I have realized that I am making a lot of mistakes while typing:

1. For capital letters, I am always pressing right shift and never left shift. Technically capital letters should be pressed with same fingers
as normal letters while pressing shift with the opposite hand.

2. I always press letter 'r' with my left middle finger, instead of index finger.

3. I always press letter 'c' with my left index finger, instead of middle finger.

4. I press letters 'x' and 'z' as I feel, sometimes with index finger, sometime with middle finger. This is completely wrong, one should use little and ring finger.

5. Letter 'b' has always been problematic for me. I always press it with right index finger instead of left one.

I have been practicing typing for the past 3 weeks and I already feel a lot of improvement. I have completely fixed points 1. 3. and 4.
Mistake 2. was only partially eliminated, because sometime I still press 'r' with my index finger depending on the previous character typed.
Habit of pressing 'b' with my right index finger is very hard to unlearn and I have given up on it. I think this does not affect the speed too much.
Most of people agree that some typing rules are more of a suggestion and you should figure out what works for you.

Most of the time I have been practicing on keybr.com. This webpage is very well designed, but has some major flaws. Very smart algorithm constructs paragraphs of words
that are specifically targeted at your learning profile. If you are typing certain characters slower and less accurate than others, the algorithm will construct words containing more of those characters, which is a very nice feature for learning. However, paragraphs that you write are not realistic and do not resemble a real world typing scenario. Anyhow, my typing speed on this platform has increased from around 60 to 80 wpm. (this is for paragraphs without capital letters and punctuations).

More acurate measurement of typing speed can be estimed from the typeracer.com platform. Typing average now stands at around 60-65 words per minute.
This means an overall improvement of 20 wpm from a 3 week training.
