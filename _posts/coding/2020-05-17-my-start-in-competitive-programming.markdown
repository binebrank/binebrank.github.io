Around two months ago, I was a bit lost between many hobbies that I wanted to pursue. Should I still continue with indie game development? Should I start learning more about linux? What about reading some books on investing? Or doing some advanced programming tutorials on Coursera? I had no idea, but I knew that with my current mentality, I have to be productive. Frankly, I cannot watch netflix, play computer games or spend too much time on social media. Don't think I haven't tried. Everytime I start doing any of these things, I get angry at myself after 5 minutes.

One day, while I was programming in the living room, my flatmate said with his (probably) sarcastic voice, that if I keep programming so much, I will end up working at Google. This intrigued me and I quickly googled: how to get a job at Google? :)
A few forums and reddit comments later, I learned that Google hosts many programming competitions online and that best participants get invited for a job interview. I was not too surprised. Big successful companies like Google probably receive thousands of applications. Having this luxury, they will obviously try to pick the best candidates. Scrolling through some past competitions, I wanted to know if I had any chance. Nevertheless, I am doing a PhD in informatics. 

I quickly realized that my knowledge on algorithms and data structures is quite poor. Time for googling: "How to become better at algorithms?". To be honest, I already knew the answer. You have to practice a lot. I have always been a hard-worker, so I am totally ok with this. Looking at some of the resources where I could train solving algorithmic tasks, I quickly realized that I am not alone in this. Lo and behold, I have discovered competitive programming.

Today is 17th of May, 11am. I am one of twenty thousand people who are at this very moment looking at their computer screen and counting last minutes until it starts. Two more minutes.
In front of the keyboard lies my notebook, opened at an empty page, pen is ready. Half of the screen is occupied by the terminal. C++ template file is opened in Vim, cursor already in insert mode.
Other half of the page is taken by the browser. URL link shows www.codeforces.com -> a russian webpage for competitive programming. Today's contest is called Educational Round 87, number of registered participants stands at around 23000. One minute left. I start to remember the first contest I took part in, around one and a half months ago. Who would have thought back then, that I discovered my new passion. Today is already my 14th contest, not to mention many hours of training, watching tutorials and analyzing solutions of other competitors. Ten, nine, eight, seven,..
As the clock reaches zero, a pop-up shows with the following message: The contest has started, please reload the page to enter the contest arena. I press F5. First problem shows up.

I carefully read the statement, input data, time constraints and examples. First problem is always the easiest and I know that this should be an easy task. I read the problem again to be absolutely sure that I didn't miss anything. I take my pen and I quickly sketch an example. My brain is analyzing the problem. What if this, what if that,... this makes sense, this does not. Around 90 seconds later, I got it. I have constructed a simple algorithm, that solves the first problem. Half of the job is done. It is time to transfer what is written on the paper to the program. A couple of "if.. else" statements, "for" loops, "while" loops and my program appears to be written. I compile it and copy the input data. As all answers are outputed correctly, I get a sudden rush. I just realized that this was insanely fast. One month of practice definitely paid off. I quickly copy my program to the browser and press the submit button. I look at the timer and I see that only 8 minutes have passed since the start. I cannot believe it. I have never solved a task so quickly. I refresh the page and look at the current standings. I am stunned. Current leader has already solved first three problems. After this quick realization, my confidence goes back to normal. I am still at the beginning of my competitive programming career. There is a long way ahead of me. Having another look at the scoreboard, I feel even more determined as I open the second problem.

Competitive programming is a mind sport, where participants are trying to program according to provided specifications. Similarly to many high-school math or physics competitions, contestants are competing in solving various problems using a programming language of their choice. They are reffered to as sport programmers.
